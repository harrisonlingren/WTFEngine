# WTF is my Startup?

## How it works

The process is very simple. The WTF Engine takes a sentence template and fills in different types of blanks with different types of words, much like the game [Mad Libs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Libs). You can nominate any amount of templates and as many different categories of words or phrases as you like.

For example, here is a basic corpus

    {
        template: [ "Big @color @animal", "Silly @animal with @color fur" ],
        animal: [ "dog", "cat", "rabbit" ],
        color: [ "red", "blue", "green", "yellow" ]
    };

As you can see, in a template you use the __@__ symbol, followed by the type of word you wish to use to tell the WTF Engine to pick a random word of that type from the corpus and insert it at that point.

## Notes

This project was based upon the original WTFEngine, [which you can find here](https://github.com/soulwire/WTFEngine). The only things I changed are the seeds for the text and the site style.
